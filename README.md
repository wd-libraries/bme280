# Connect your ESP8266 and BME280 sensor and build an online dashboard. Trigger email/sms/webhook alerts for critical values.

This example code demonstrates reading temperature, pressure, and humidity from the BME280 sensor using an ESP8266 microcontroller. It stores the data and presents it in a web dashboard. It also lets you trigger sending email, sms messages, or calling webhooks if the sensor data attains critical values.

See the tutorial at [https://wombatdashboard.com/tutorials/bme280](https://wombatdashboard.com/tutorials/bme280) for an explanation of the code and hardware implementation.
